#  AI-Powered Missing Person Finder System

An end-to-end **Missing Person Finder system** that uses **face detection, face recognition, REST APIs, and modern web technologies** to match uploaded images against a database of missing persons.

This repository contains **sample implementations** of all major components required to build a real-world AI-based identification system.

---

##  Project Objective

To design a system where:
- Users can **report missing persons**
- Users can **search for missing persons**
- Uploaded images are **matched using AI-based face recognition**
- Results are returned with **match confidence**
